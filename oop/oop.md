# Object Oriented Programming

### Class
- A class is a blueprint which is used to create instance/object
- A class is conists of property of objects and behaviour
- The size of an empty class in C++ is usually one byte `class EmptyClass {};` 
- If the size of an empty class were zero then two different objects of the same class would have the same address which would be confusing for the compiler;

- Classes can have access specifiers, which control which members of  a class accessed from outside of the class

### Object
- An object is instance of a class.


### Access Specifiers
#### Private
- default data members are private

#### Public
- A public data members and methods can be accessed within and outside the class

#### Protected

#### This keyword
- this is a keyword that refers to the current instance of the class.
- it can also be used to pass current object as a parameter to another method.
- It can be used to refer current class instnace variable.
