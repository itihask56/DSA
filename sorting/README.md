- In this algorithm we have to find the minimum value in the list first. Then, Swap it with the value in the first position. After that, Start from the second position and repeat the steps above for remainder of the list.
- It performs well with small array
- It is a unstable algorithm, meaning it may not maintain the relative order of equal elements in the input array
