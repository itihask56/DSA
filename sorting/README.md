# Sorting Algorithms
## Selection sort
- In this algorithm, we have to find the minimum value in the list first. Then, Swap it with the value in the first position. After that, Start from the second position and repeat the steps above for the remainder of the list.
- It performs well with a small array
- It is an unstable algorithm, meaning it may not maintain the relative order of equal elements in the input array
 
## Bubble Sort
- It works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- The largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first.
- Not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high

## Insertion sort
- It assumes that the first element is already sorted
- we select an unsorted element and if the unsorted element is greater than the first element we move the element to the right side otherwise it will be placed at the left side
